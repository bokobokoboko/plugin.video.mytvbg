Readme for XMBC mytvbg plugin created boris.todorov@gmail.com

I created this addon to watch MyTV.bg (Voyo) on my Ubuntu media station.
This plugin is based on neterratv  plugin  by  Mr.Olix@gmail.com.
I should mention that this is the first time I use PHYTON, so as you can imagine it is not perfect.

How to install:

1. Copy the zip file plugin.video.mytvbg-x.x.x.zip to a directory XMBC server has access to 
	e.g. <USERDIR>\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\addons\packages\
2. Run XBMC and go to System -> Add-ons
3. From Add-ons menu select -> Install from zip file
4. Select the zip file plugin.video.mytvbg-x.x.x.zip
5. MyTV.bg add-on will appear in the video addon list
6. Before you run it you have to provide login information
	For this select the addon in the list and the PC use right mouse button 
	on AppleTV long press Menu on the remote control
